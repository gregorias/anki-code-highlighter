An Anki plugin that creates highlighted code blocks. This plugin uses a
colorscheme that works in day and night modes. It also works on both, Anki for
desktop and AnkiDroid.

<b>Caveats</b><br />
This add-on adds a custom stanza to your card templates. This is necessary to
have the add-on work in an upgradeable manner. The add-on provides a convenient
menu command to removing all stanzas if you decide you want to remove the
plugin.

<b>Use</b>
<ol>
  <li>
    Select text that you want to create a code block from or copy code to
    clipboard and put a cursor at its desired destination.
  </li>
  <li>Press CTRL+' or click the add-on’s button.</li>
</ol>
