## Features

* Uses a color scheme that works in day and night modes.
* Works on Anki for desktop and AnkiDroid.

## Installation

### Fetching from AnkiWeb

The recommended way to install this plugin is directly from
[AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/112228974) using Anki's add-on
management.

### Fetching from source

Alternatively, you can install this plugin from source.

1. Run `package`.
2. Import `codehighlighter.ankiaddon` in Anki.

## Usage

1. Write a code snippet in a card editor.
2. Select your code snippet.
3. Press `CTRL+'` (on macOS, `⌘+'`) or click this add-on's button in the
   editor's button bar.

For the list of supported languages and their corresponding codes, see
`assets/_ch-hljs-lang-*.min.js` files in this repository.

### Supported highlighters

* [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) — This highlighter highlights during
  card display. It supports only code blocks.
* [pygments](https://pygments.org/) — This highlighter creates highlighting
  tags when you run this plugin. This is useful for creating cloze cards.
  It supports both inline code and code blocks.

### Configuration

The plugin accepts the following configuration options:

- `css-files` (default lives in `codehighlighter/main.py`) — the list of CSS styles to use.
- `shortcut` (e.g. `ctrl+;`) — this sets the shortcut that triggers this plugin.
- `default-highlighter` (`highlight.js`, `pygments`, ``) — this sets the default highlighting mechanism.

### Custom styles

This plugin supports a modified solarized theme out of the box (its day and
night variants), but you may install your own style for highlighting with
highlight.js (instructions for Pygments are not supported yet due to a more
complicated setup).

To setup a custom style, do the following:

1. Download your new style from [the list of available
   styles](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/main/src/styles).
1. Rename the CSS stylesheet file to start with `_`. This is necessary to
   prevent garbage collection from Anki when you save it in the media
   directory. Let's say you named it `_ch-my-style.css`.
1. Save the CSS stylesheet file into [your Anki profile's media
   directory]. If you have already installed this plugin, the media
   directory should contain this plugin's assets, e.g.,
   `_ch-hljs-solarized.css`.
1. Open this plugin's configuration in Anki and change the value of
   [`css-files`](#configuration) to use your new stylesheet, e.g.,:

   ```json
   {
     "css-files": [
       "_ch-my-style.css",
       "_ch-pygments-solarized.css",
     ]
   }
   ```

   In the example above, we keep the default styles for Pygments.
1. [Refresh this plugin's assets.](#refresh--removal).

Your new styles will work now. You may customize it further by adding a custom
border or add a separte style for dark mode. For how it's done, see
[`_ch-hljs-solarized.css`](https://github.com/gregorias/anki-code-highlighter/blob/main/assets/_ch-hljs-solarized.css).


## Refresh & Removal

This plugin installs its own JS and CSS files. It also modifies card
templates. You need to run some manual steps if you:

- add a new template
- want to delete the plugin

If you add a new card template, run `Extras/Tools > Refresh Code Highlighter
Assets`.

To remove the plugin, run `Extras/Tools > Delete Code Highlighter Assets`
before deleting the plugin using Anki's internal add-on system. This
manual step is necessary until Anki adds [add-on lifecycle
hooks](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/install-update-delete-addon-hook-points/18532).

## For Developers

### Dev Environment Setup

1. Install the required Python version:

   ```shell
   pyenv install CHECK_PIPFILE
   ```

1. Set up Pipenv:

    ```shell
    pipenv install --dev
    ```

1. Set up npm:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

1. Install Lefthook:

    ```shell
    lefthook install
    ```

### Updating highlight.js

`_assets/_cs-highlight.js` contains the single-file implementation of
[highlight.js][hljs]. It comes from the ZIP package available on [their main
site][hljs].

### Generating Pygment stylesheets

In `assets/_ch-pygment-solarized.css` I keep the stylesheet for code formatted
with pygments plus a few lines for general styles. I generated the style there with
`dev/bin/pygutils.py` with some minor adjustments by hand:

1. There are some tech debt lines relevant for all `<pre><code>` tags.
2. I have added some custom styles for borders.

### Testing

1. Run unit tests and mypy with `testall`.
2. Test supported Anki versions (2.1.49 and latest) by packaging the plugin and
   importing the plugin into the lowest and the newest support Anki.

### Release & distribution

1. Create a release commit.
    1. Bump up the package version in `codehighlighter/manifest.json`.
    2. Tag the release commit `git tag vx.y.z && git push origin vx.y.z`.
2. Use the `dev/bin/package` tool to create `codehighlighter.ankiaddon`.
3. [Share the package on Anki.](https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net/#/sharing)

### Design Decisions

This section discuss some design decisions made for this plugin.

### Using `assets/_ch*` files for CSS and JS

The asset files start with an underscore, because then Anki ignores them
([source](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankidesktop/39510-anki-is-completely-ignoring-media-files-starting-with-underscores-when-cleaning-up)).

This plugin saves its assets directly in the global `assets` directory.

* The only way to share files seems to be through `collection.media`.
* Anki does not support file directories in `collection.media`.

#### Alternatives considered

##### Fetching CSS and JS assets from Internet

Loading files from Internet has the disadvantage of making my Anki solving
experience depend on Internet.
