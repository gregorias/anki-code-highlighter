## Features

* Uses a color scheme that works in day and night modes.
* Works on Anki for desktop and AnkiDroid.

## Installation

### Fetching from AnkiWeb

You can install directly from
[AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/112228974) using Anki's add-on
management.

### Fetching from source

Alternatively you can install this plugin from source.

1. Run `package`.
2. Import `codehighlighter.ankiaddon` in Anki.

## Refresh & Removal

This plugin installs its own JS and CSS files as well as modifies card
templates. You need to run some manual steps if you add a new card template or
want to delete the plugin.

If you add a new card template, run `Extras/Tools > Refresh Code Highlighter
Assets`.

To remove the plugin, run `Extras/Tools > Delete Code Highlighter Assets`
before deleting the plugin using Anki's internal add-on system. This manual
step is necessary until Anki adds [add-on lifecycle
hooks](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/install-update-delete-addon-hook-points/18532).

## Usage

1. Write a code snippet in a card editor.
2. Select your code snippet and press `CTRL+'`.

For the list of supported languages and their corresponding codes, see
`assets/_ch-hljs-lang-*.min.js` files.

## Design

This section discuss some design decisions made for this plugin.

### Using `assets/_ch*` files for CSS and JS

This plugin saves its assets directly in the global `assets` directory.

* The only way to share files seems to be through `collection.media`.
* Anki does not support file directories in `collection.media`.

#### Alternatives considered

##### Fetching CSS and JS assets from Internet

Loading files from Internet has the disadvantage of making my Anki solving
experience depend on Internet.

## For Developers

### Dev Environment Setup

Set up Pipenv:

    pipenv install --dev

Set up npm:

    npm install

Install Lefthook:

    lefthook install

### Updating highlight.js

`_assets/_cs-highlight.js` contains the single-file implementation of
[highlight.js][hljs]. It comes from the ZIP package available on [their main
site][hljs].

### Generating Pygment stylesheets

In `assets/_ch-pygment-solarized.css` I keep the stylesheet for code formatted
with pygments plus a few lines for general styles. I generated the style there with
`dev/bin/pygutils.py` with some minor adjustments by hand:

1. There are some tech debt lines relevant for all `<pre><code>` tags.
2. I have added some custom styles for borders.

### Testing

1. Run unit tests and mypy with `testall`.
2. Test supported Anki versions by packaging the plugin and importing the
   plugin into the lowest and the newest support Anki.

### Release

This section will contain instructions on release a new user-facing version.

### Distribution

See [Anki's documentation on sharing
add-ons](https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net/#/sharing).

Use the `package` tool to create the zip.

### Design Decisions

The asset files start with an underscore, because then Anki ignores them
([source](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankidesktop/39510-anki-is-completely-ignoring-media-files-starting-with-underscores-when-cleaning-up)).
